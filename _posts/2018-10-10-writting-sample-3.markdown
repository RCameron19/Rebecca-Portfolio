Haunted Escape Room: Are YOU Ready? 
 
CINCINNATI OHIO --- This Halloween season, we invite you to check out the spooky in-home laboratory of husband and wife scientists who are on the brink of discovering a cure for the infamous outbreak in our haunted escape room at OTR Escape. Be prepared for mind tingling fright and thrill because this adventure starts the minute that you don’t receive the warm welcome you might be expecting!
This expanded escape room is sixty minutes long with two floors, two timed rooms, and clues spread without eight total rooms. We can guarantee that this experience is better than your average 20 minute haunted house! 
The haunted escape room is available for players through November 4, 2018. On Fridays and Saturdays, the experience is available from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m., and on most weekends, it is open from 7 p.m. to 9 or 10 p.m. On Haloween, join us until midnight! 
Tickets start at $32 per person; however, if you act right NOW, you can grab your tickets for $24 with our flash sale! Use the code HAUNTED25 at checkout for 25% off.
What are you waiting for? We can’t wait to scare you at 1112 Race Street, Cincinnati, OH 45202.  
If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at 513-857-1533 or email us at otrescape@gmail.com.
