Sough Gentle:  (Sough means the sound that the wind makes blowing through the trees and water and the logo for this business is a leaf that looks like a fingerprint) My company is a vegan skincare/beauty brand with the mission statement that self-love is unique and starts on the inside.  

Self-love is as unique as your fingerprint. Every single person is a beautiful creation that needs to be loved uniquely. Sough Gentle believes in giving you a helping hand in being your best self. Itâ€™s as easy as the wind blowing through the trees and we can promise that you are worth the investment. 

All the products are handmade with you in mind. We love you so much that we have eliminated all the harsh chemicals found in most products and left you with the most gentle, animal-byproduct free goods. It is our mission to remind you how loved and unique you are from start to finish. We hope that you will use our products and fall in love with who you are from the inside out.
