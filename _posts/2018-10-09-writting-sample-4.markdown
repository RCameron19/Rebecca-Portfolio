Writing Sample 4: Excerpt from an essay I wrote this past month that I did exceptionally well on. The premise of the paper is discussing the benefits of working remote. However, employers have a harder time allowing women to work remote because of their roles within their families. The original paper is nine pages long. Below, I am showing about three pages of it along with my resources page.

The ideas of working from home and having a flexible schedule are becoming a more popular idea to study. It is a growing trend that is becoming more possible because of the evolution of technology and the shifts in family demographics.  “Telecommuting has taken center stage as businesses and policymakers recognize American workers’ desire for more flexibility, whether they are parents squeezed for time for family care or millennials expecting more time for personal needs” (Glass and Noonan:2016).  The good thing about companies becoming more flexible with employees schedule is that it is a low- cost solution to a healthy relationship between the employer and the employee. Some companies, such as Yahoo, have experimented with remote work and decided that they saw more value in face-to-face interactions. This is becoming an old school style of thinking because the work environment is changing. One thing that tends to hold employers back from allowing their employees to work remote is the fear of them not being available when they are needed (Glass and Noonan:2016). What it comes down to is employers being afraid of letting go of control. American culture focuses on controlling as much as possible. However, on the opposite side, with the dependence of smartphones, tablets, and other screens, there is the idea that work hours can and have increased because an employee can take their work home with them. White-collar employees are the most affected by the expectations of working overtime because of their field revolving around the use and continuous growth of technology.  Meanwhile, scholars have done countless studies on remote workers being preferred. There have been a lot of newer studies to show how productivity is positively affected by telecommuting. 

Telecommuting is an appealing concept to many because it is a feasible way to show that efforts are being made to create an overall more healthy lifestyle. Many scholars view it as an efficient way to boost productivity levels. By allowing employees to have more control over their time, they are more likely to stay at their job long term. The value of telecommuting is understanding the relationship between the employer and the employee. An employer that values an employee as a person will do what they can to assure that they are living a healthy life.  “Supervisor support for family and personal life involves providing emotional support for employees' work-life challenges, modeling how supervisors themselves handle work-family issues, looking for creative solutions that meet the needs of both employees and organizations and facilitating employees' flexible work practices”(Kelly et al. 2014 2014:487). An employee that feels respected by their employer will be more likely to put in more work than expected. It is no secret that it is much easier to have a desire to do more than expected when the effort is noticed and appreciated. Studies have been conducted to show positive changes from the transformation to a more flexible schedule in regards to employees having a healthier work-life balance. “Studies have indicated that work schedule flexibility is positively associated with some features of family life such as positive parenting and the quality and quantity of time spent with children” (Jang, Zippay, and Park:2012). 

Another good outcome to come from the transformation to a flexible, remote schedule is the possibility of having a compressed work week. For example, the benefits of working four long days and having one weekday off could allow employees to have a day to catch up on housework. This type of schedule could help employees have a healthy work-life balance by maintaining healthy habits through these type of progressive changes in the workforce. This idea comes from the concept of shared responsibilities. If both spouses were able to have a similar schedule, it would allow an equal disbursement of duties at home and work. Although this idea is still fairly progressive for many people, it is shown to have high success rates when it comes to the overall health of family dynamics.  

CONFLICT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN
There is still a significant amount of social-conflict amongst those who are privileged enough to work remote. There is an extreme bias towards the belief that men are more productive than women when they work remotely based on stereotypes alone. “The stigma placed on workers, disproportionately women, who openly display their family care responsibilities by being visibly pregnant, bringing a child to work, or leaving early for a school event could contribute to lower earnings directly through evaluation bias and indirectly through assignment to less important work tasks”  (Glass and Noonan:2016). Employers are quick to assume that women have a desire to telecommute to have more time and energy to manage their families. There are endless stereotypes about women and mothers that they are overall less productive and committed to their work. Statistics about remote productivity are skewed against women more times than not because they are based on expectations and not the actual analysis of work productivity (Jang, Zippay, and Park:2012). Women who are pregnant, bring their child to work, or leave work for school events are more susceptible to lower wages and the assignment of less important jobs just because of their dedication to family obligations. 
Because many men will not admit to the need of work flexibility for work-family balance, employers do not often see the connection between a man’s desire for working remote and family responsibilities. With that being said, further research shows that men and women are both affected by the lack of a work-life balance. There has been a sharp increase in men reporting work-family conflicts in recent years (Jang, Zippay, and Park:2012). These conflicts are highest in high-demanding jobs and dual-earning households where both parents are working.
