Respite Care Starts With You 

 
DAYTON,OHIO— Alzheimer’s is the fourth leading cause of death in American adults. Not only does the illness affect the patients, but it has an immense impact on the entire family. Primary caregivers are left in a high-risk category for stress-related diseases. Due to the high stress of caring for an Alzheimer’s patient, it is essential for caregivers to get time off, regardless of how short that time may be. 

Next Saturday and Sunday, Sand Lake Hospital is introducing a new concept of “Community Respite Care Weekend.” The weekend will be dedicated to giving caregivers to an Alzheimer’s patient time off to destress while their loved one is in the care of generous, trained volunteers and nursing professionals. Similar respite care will be offered on the first weekend of each month at the facility. The new program also provides in-home volunteer help and a subsidized adult day care. 

With this program comes a lot of volunteer work and there is a demand for willing individuals to endure the challenging work to help create a successful project. Respite Project director, Charlotte McFarland, is requesting help in her statement, “Anyone who has an interest in volunteering their time is greatly needed. Our program relies solely on volunteer power to staff both the in-home and hospital respite. We realize many people may find this type of voluntarism difficult, however, the devoted people we do have, find much personal satisfaction and reward once they see how much they help and the difference they make to these families”.

For more information on how you can get involved, you can contact Charlotte McFarland at 425-2489.
