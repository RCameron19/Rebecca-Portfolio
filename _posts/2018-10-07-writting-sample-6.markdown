Rebecca: 

 I’m Rebecca Kochanek! Behind the bold lipstick and quirky personality, I am a writer and businesswoman at heart. I believe the best days are the ones spent at a coffee shop, creating beauty within the world. I’m a firm believer in iced coffee over hot coffee, bold lipstick can fix any bad day, and that confidence is the best attribute to have. 

My expertise is writing and speaking with goals of speaking publically and publishing a book within the year. I fell in love with communications in all forms at a young age, and I have allowed that love to mold me into who I am today. Currently, I am working on my degree at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin and will be done by December of 2019. At the same time, I am working on building my own business from the ground up called Sough Gentle. The company is a skincare business with an emphasis on self-love starting on the inside. 

When I’m not behind my computer screen, I am most likely at the gym, doing yoga, taking long walks with my husband, or road tripping. I have a passion for traveling and trying new things, whether it be food or a new activity. Alongside that, I am a speaker from the core of my being so I am always seeking speaking engagements. 

Currently, I am seeking out freelance work for content writing, social media content writing, and speaking engagements.
