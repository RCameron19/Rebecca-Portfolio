Kyle: 
 Have you met…. Kyle Kochanek? 

Hi, I’m Kyle! The most important things that you should know about me is that I am a dad humor activist, coffee and IPA connoisseur, and a husband to the apple of my eye. Currently, I am a product designer at Roadtrippers. Roadtrippers is an app that helps you plan exquisite road trips with the coolest stops all catered to what the user wants to see. Currently, my personal projects range from working with my wife with branding design for our launching business and an app to maintain healthy habits. 

When I am not working or annoying my wife with my endless dad humor, you can find me running the trails listening to an array of podcasts, learning new skills, and sometimes watching cartoons on Saturday mornings. 

As of right now, I am not open for freelance work, but please take a look at my portfolio. If anything sparks your interest, please follow me on my socials and let’s connect and grab a coffee.
