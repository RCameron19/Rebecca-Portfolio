          <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing Sample 4: Excerpt from an essay I wrote this past month that I did exceptionally well on. The premise of the paper is discussing the benefits of working remote. However, employers have a harder time allowing women to work remote because of their roles within their families. The original paper is nine pages long. Below, I am showing about three pages of it along with my resources page.&lt;/p&gt;

Respite Care Starts With You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAYTON,OHIO— Alzheimer’s is the fourth leading cause of death in American adults. Not only does the illness affect the patients, but it has an immense impact on the entire family. Primary caregivers are left in a high-risk category for stress-related diseases. Due to the high stress of caring for an Alzheimer’s patient, it is essential for caregivers to get time off, regardless of how short that time may be.&lt;/p&gt;
